<p>
 <B>DESCRIPTION</B>
<br>
<I>xgobi</I> is an interactive dynamic graphics program for data
visualization in the X Window System.  It is especially
designed for the exploration of multivariate data.  Its
basic plot is a scatterplot, and these are some of the tools
available for scatterplot display and manipulation:
<ul>
<li>
  Cycling rapidly through two-variable scatter plots.
<li>
  Three-dimensional rotation, including trackball control,
    in spaces spanned by three variables at a time.
<li>
  Grand tours and correlation tours: smooth randomized
  sequences of two-dimensional projections in order to explore
  a higher-dimensional point cloud of multivariate data.
  Projections can be manually controlled and optimized with
  projection pursuit.
<li>
  Brushing: the ability to change the color or plotting
  character of a point or a group of points.
<li>
  Hiding groups:  using checkboxes to specify which brushed
  groups should be plotted, or included in calculations.
<li>
  Scaling: moving and reshaping the plot interactively.
<li>
  Identification: displaying a label next to a point in
  the plot window.
<li>
  Linked views: Brushing, identification and touring are linked;
  that is, actions in the window of one XGobi process are
  immediately reflected in another XGobi window displaying the
  same data.
<li>
  Line editing: Any pair of points can be connected with a
  line segment.
<li>
  Moving points:  Points can be moved on the screen.  In
  higher-dimensional views, the motion is interpreted as
  taking place in some plane parallel to the screen.
<li>
  Smooths: Smooth curves can be drawn through point
  clouds.
<li>
  Subsetting: Subsamples can be drawn either systematically or randomly.
<li>
  Jittering: Variables can be jittered, which is useful
  for discrete variables that take on only few values.
<li>
  Parallel coordinate display: shown in a separate
  linked window, linked to the main window.
<li>
  Case label list: shown in a separate window,
  linked to the main window for labeling points.
<li>
  Missing values: are accepted and can be dealt with by
  imputation of constant values, random values, or user-supplied
  imputed values.  Missing value patterns can be examined in a
  separate linked XGobi window.
<li>
  Variable transformations: A menu of transformations such
  as logs and a few powers is available.
<li>
  Postscript plotting: The contents of the plot windows
  can be written out to postscript files for high-quality
  plotting.
<li>
  Online help: Most of the XGobi buttons and windows have
  associated help files that can be displayed during an
  XGobi session.  Click on the <I>Info</I> button toward the top
  right of the window for instructions.
</ul>

<p>
XGobi has a direct manipulation interface, and all the above
actions are performed using the mouse.

<p>
XGobi can be used in conjunction with the S language for
scientific computing and data analysis.  Execute
<I>help</I>(<I>xgobi</I>) within S or Splus for information; if
the xgobi function has not been installed, investigate the XGobi
distribution files.

<p>
XGobi can also be programmed to use RPC (Remote Procedure
Calls) to communicate with other software.

<p>
 <B>OPTIONS</B>

<p>
<B>-subset</B> n
<br>
 Specify the size n of the random sample of the data to be
 displayed on startup.  Although only the random sample is
 shown, all the data is read in and available during the
 session.  Use the subset panel in Tools to change the sample
 size and sampling method during the session.

  <B>-only</B> n/N

 Specify the size <I>n</I> of the random sample of
 the data to be read in on startup from a file of
 <I>N</I> rows.  In constrast to subset, this option
 does <B>not</B> read in all data.

  <B>-only</B> a,n

 Specify the initial row <I>a</I> and the number of rows <I>n</I>
 in the consecutive block of data to read in.  In
 constrast to subset, this option does <B>not</B> read
 in all data.

<p>
<B>-std</B> mmx|msd|mmd
<br>
  By default, the data are scaled into the plotting window
  using the minimum and maximum values of each variable or
  variable group, in such a way that the midpoint of the
  variable is at the center of the plotting window and no
  points fall outside the window.  Instead, to scale using
  mean and largest distance, specify -<I>std</I> <I>msd</I>; to scale
  using the median and largest distance, specify
  -<I>std</I> <I>mmd</I>.

<p>
<B>-mono</B>
<br>
  Emulate a black-and-white display.  This simplifies producing pictures for many publications.

<p>
<B>-version</B>
<br>
  Print a version date, the last date that any file in the
  release was changed.

<p>
<B>-scatmat</B>
<br>
  Build a scatterplot matrix of the input data, and display
  it in the plotting window.  It is linked by default to
  other xgobi windows.

<p>
<b> X options </b>
<br>
  The standard X command line options can be used with
  XGobi.  These include -<I>display</I> <I>machinename</I>:<I>0</I>, used when
  running an X program on one machine and displaying its
  output on another, and -<I>title</I> <I>Title</I>, where <I>Title</I> is a
  string you want to appear in the window manager titlebar.

<p>
<B>FILES</B>
<br>

XGobi accepts standard input, but is most often used with files,
partly because of the additional plot control that can be
achieved using a set of files.  The data input file should be an
ASCII file with the data matrix arranged in rows and columns; in
ASCII, rows must be distinguished by carriage returns, and
columns can be separated by any amount of white space.  Missing
values can be coded as ".", "NA" or "na".  (The input file can
also be a binary file, which can be produced within XGobi once
the ASCII data has been read in.)  XGobi accepts other input
about the display of the data from files as well. 

<p>
If the data is in a file named
<p>
<B>filename</B> or <B>filename.dat</B> (either of which must be an ASCII file), or
<br>
<B>filename.bin</B> (the binary version of the data),

<p>
then the other files are as follows:

<p>
<B>filename.row</B>
<br>
<B>filename.rowlab</B>
<br>
<B>filename.case</B>
<br>

  Row or case labels: a label for each row of the data
  matrix, which is displayed in the identification mode.
  The file should contain one label per line.

<p>
<B>filename.col</B>
<br>
<B>filename.collab</B>
<br>
<B>filename.column</B>
<br>
<B>filename.var</B>
<br>

  Column or variable labels: a label for each column of the
  data matrix, which becomes part of the XGobi variable
  selection panel.  The file should contain one label per line.
<p>
  To add a short label to be used in the parallel coordinates plot,
  use the vertical bar "|" as a field separator
  and add the short name, so each line looks like this:  fullname|shortname.
<p>
<B>filename.colors</B>
<br>

  Brushing colors: a color for each point in the plot, representing a row or case of the data.  The file should contain one color per line.  (It is probably best if the colors correspond to the colors used in brushing; see the
  later section on resources.)
<p>
<B>filename.glyphs</B>
<br>

  Brushing glyphs: a glyph type for each point in the plot,
  representing a row or case of the data.  The file should
  contain one glyph type per line.  The glyph types are as
  follows:
<pre>
     1 through 5: Five sizes of '+'
     6 through 10: Five sizes of 'X'
     11 through 15: Five sizes of open rectangle
     16 through 20: Five sizes of filled rectangle
     21 through 25: Five sizes of open circle
     26 through 30: Five sizes of filled circle
     31: A single-pixel point
</pre>
<p>
<B>filename.erase</B>
<br>
  Erase: a column of 1s (to have a point erased on startup)
  and 0s (to have the point plotted).  There should be one
  value per line and as many lines as there are rows in the
  data.
<p>
<B>filename.lines</B>
<br>
  Line segments: specifications for the pattern of line segments
  which connect pairs of points.  The file should contain two
  numbers per line.  The pair of numbers represents the row
  numbers of the two points that should be connected.
<p>
<B>filename.linecolors</B>
<br>
  Line colors: a color for each line in the .lines file.
  The file should contain one color per line.  (It is best
  if the colors correspond to the colors used in brushing;
  see the later section on resources.)
<p>
<B>filename.nlinkable</B>
<br>
  The number of rows to be linked for brushing and
  identification.  By default, nlinkable is equal to the number
  of rows in the data.  This feature can be used to link ordinary
  scatterplots with plots that have some decorations requiring
  additional points, such as clustering trees.
<p>
<B>filename.vgroups</B>
<br>
  Variable groups: an integer for each column in the data.  Each
  set of columns that is represented by the same integer will
  grouped together for scaling and transformation.  The file is
  just one long line of integers.  For example, an input file
  with four columns could have a .vgroups file containing the
  line 1 2 2 3.  The second and third columns are then grouped
  together.  The range of their plotting axes is the same, and
  if column 2 is transformed, column 3 is transformed at the same
  time.
<p>
<B>filename.rgroups</B>
<br>
  Row groups: an integer for each row in the data.  Each set
  of rows that is represented by the same integer will
  grouped together for brushing.  In addition, line groups
  will be derived from the row groups:  all lines between
  points in the same row group will be in the same line
  group.  The file is just one column, and the numbers don't
  need to be in any sort of sequence.
<p>
<B>filename.missing</B>
<br>
  A file identical in structure to filename.dat, where non-zero
  values indicate positions with missing (or censored, or
  otherwise exceptional) values.  This file represents the
  pattern of missing values in the data; it can be examined in a
  separate XGobi window by selecting <I>Launch</I> <I>missing</I>
  <I>data</I> <I>XGobi</I>... from the <I>Tools</I> menu.
<p>
<B>filename.imp</B>
<br>
  Multiple imputations of missing values: Each column should
  have a full set of imputed values.  The number of rows
  needs to be identical to the number of non-zero values in
  filename.missing, or the number of missing codes in
  filename.dat if filename.missing is not provided..  The
  imputed values should be given in their order in the data
  column by column.  For example, if filename.dat looks like
  this:
<pre>
    10 NA 12 -3
    98  0 10  0
    77  3 NA -5
     1  2 NA 10
    NA NA  5 -8
     0  0 10 12
</pre>

  (six cases, four variables, five missing values), then
  filename.imp with two sets of imputed values could look
  like this:

<pre>
    54  37
     3   2
     4   1
    11  10
    13  11
</pre>

<p>
  If the second column is selected for imputation (Select
  <I>Impute</I> <I>missing</I> <I>values</I> from the
  <I>Tools</I> menu), the full data matrix with imputations looks
  like this:

<pre>
    10  2 12 -3
    98  0 10  0
    77  3 10 -5
     1  2 11 10
    37  1  5 -8
     0  0 10 12
</pre>

<p>
<B>filename.resources</B>
<br>
  Resources: a set of datafile-specific XGobi resources,
  which specify the size of the plotting window and some
  user-selection option settings.  The file is in the format
  of a standard X resource file.  It can be directly edited
  so that other resources can be specified.  See the later
  section on resource files for more information.

<p>
All of the above files can be created outside of XGobi,
using an editor or other UNIX utilities, and several of them
(glyphs and colors, line segments and line color, resources)
can be written out during an XGobi session, in which case
they represent the results of interactions performed during
that session.

<p>
 <B>X11 RESOURCE FILES</B>
<br>
X11 resource files are used to control size, color, layout,
labels, and various other windowing features.  The XGobi
resources you are most likely to find useful set the sizes
of the plotting window and the variable selection panel, the
colors available for brushing, the font types and sizes, and
the title appearing in the title bar of the X window.  Some
examples follow:

<p>
In this example, the first 5 of the 10 brushing colors are
specified.  These colors should be drawn from the set of
colors available on your workstation or X terminal, which
you can probably determine using the X command 'showrgb.'
<pre>
     *brushColor0: white
     *brushColor1: red
     *brushColor2: green
     *brushColor3: skyblue
     *brushColor4: yellow
</pre>

<p>
Here, the sizes of the plotting window and variable selection panel are set.  All units are in pixels.  This file was
created interactively during an XGobi session.

<pre>
     *XGobi*PlotWindow.height: 120
     *XGobi*PlotWindow.width: 490
     *XGobi*VarPanel.width: 390
</pre>

<p>
These two resources allow the variable widgets to be reduced
in size, which is helpful when there are many variables in
the data.

<pre>
     *XGobi*VarWindow.width: 36
     *XGobi*VarLabel.width:  36
</pre>

<p>
Here, the title and font have been adjusted for making a
videotape.  An explanatory title and a large font are used.

<pre>
     *XGobi.title:    XGobi: Experimental Laser Data
     *XGobi.iconName: XGobi: Laser
     *plotFont: -*-lucida-medium-r-normal-sans-20-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
</pre>

<p>
Several logical variables controlling XGobi's behavior can
be defined in a resource file.  These are also represented
by buttons, most of which are found on the Option menu
accessed from the main panel.  Descriptions can be found in
the help window for each button.

<pre>
     *showAxes: True
     *showPoints: True
     *showLines: True
     *linkBrush: True
     *linkLineBrush: True
     *linkIdentify: True
     *linkTour: True
     *plotSquare: True
     *jumpBrush: True
     *reshapeBrush: True
     *carryVars: True
     *glyphType: 6
     *glyphSize: 1
     *defaultPrintCmd: lpr -Pps1
</pre>
